## WELCOME:
This is the README.md for the Challenge THREE "Password Generator" for the UT Coding Bootcamp.

This is a website featuring javascript enabling you to generate a random password.
I plan on the following options:

* Choose from two different password styles (random characters OR XKCD style taken from below comic)
* Variable password length

## HOW TO:
Press the button corresponding to the style of password you want generated.
